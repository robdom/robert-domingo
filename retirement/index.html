  <h1>Announcing my Retirement as a Sports Fan</h1>

<div class="article-text">
  <p>Today I announce my retirement as a sports fan.</p>

  <p>I’ve had a 40-year career.</p>

  <p>I've watched the NY Mets and NY Yankees win the World Series, the NY Giants win the Super Bowl, and the NY Knicks make it to the NBA Finals. (I was away when the NY Rangers won the Stanley Cup.)</p>

  <p>I've gone to Knicks games at Madison Square Garden, Mets games at Shea Stadium and Citi Field, Yankees games at Yankee Stadium and I stood in the Timbers Army section at Providence Park for a Portland Timbers match.</p>

  <p>I've followed basketball, baseball, football, the Olympics, hockey, men's college basketball, Premier League & Champions League football, tennis, golf, and T20 cricket.</p>

  <p>I've also been a fan of various non-traditional sports:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Survival of the Fittest, a 1980s precursor to obstacle courses like American Ninja Warrior and Spartan Race</li>
    <li>Race Across America (cycling)</li>
    <li>Ironman Triathlon</li>
    <li>NYC Marathon</li>
    <li>Tour de France</li>
    <li>Beach volleyball</li>
    <li>Figure skating & ice dancing</li>
    <li>World Series of Poker</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>But today my sports fan career comes to an end.</p>

  <h2>Sports Fan Rehab</h2>

  <p>I've been going through my own self-directed "sports fan rehab" for the past two months.</p>

  <p>I haven't ingested any sports or sports content.</p>

  <p>No Knicks basketball or other NBA basketball.</p>

  <p>No podcasts like The Bill Simmons Podcast, The Lowe Post, or No Dunks.</p>

  <p>But I can't stay in rehab forever.</p>

  <p>I have to walk out the doors of the rehab facility and decide how I'm going to live.</p>

  <h2>Why I'm Retiring</h2>

  <p>Sports takes up too much of my valuable time and attention.</p>

  <p>There’s always another sports event to watch.</p>

  <p>There are people who get paid to watch sports.</p>

  <p>I’m not one of them.</p>

  <p>The Knicks are in the NBA playoffs for the first time since the 2012-2013 season...and I won't be watching.</p>

  <p>No more Super Bowls.</p>

  <p>No more Final Fours.</p>

  <p>No more World Cups.</p>

  <p>I'm hanging up my sports fan cleats.</p>

  <h2>What I'll Do Instead</h2>

  <p>Athletes often have to make a significant transition to their post-playing days.</p>

  <p>Same for retired sports fans like me.</p>

  <p>I'll work on building a business instead of watching athletes compete for championships.</p>

  <p>I'll sleep instead of listening to NBA podcasts in the dark at 1:30 AM.</p>

  <p>I'll do deep breathing exercises in the middle of a stressful situation instead of typing "es" (for ESPN.com) into my Firefox web browser looking for a way to escape.</p>

  <p>I'll do push-ups, squats, and sprints instead of watching other men run up and down the court, field, or pitch.</p>

  <p>I'll obsess over my own stats like monthly recurring revenue and customer satisfaction scores instead of obsessing over another player or team's won-loss record.</p>

  <p>I'll throw a ticker-tape parade for my own World Championship...ride a bus down my own Canyon of Heroes...and make a triumphant speech at my own City Hall.</p>

  <h2>I Had a Good Run</h2>

  <p>It’s possible I might come out of sports fan retirement.</p>

  <p>Michael Jordan and Michael Phelps came out of retirement, and I might too.</p>

  <p>If the Knicks go on a deep playoff run with home games in an electric Madison Square Garden, it would be very difficult to stay on the sidelines.</p>

  <p>Until then...sports will go on without me.</p>

  <p>I had a good run.</p>

  <p>It’s time to start my post-sports-fan career.</p>
