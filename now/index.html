  <p>I'm still living in NYC. I just finished the <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/css-and-layout-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Learn Enough CSS Layout to Be Dangerous tutorial</a> and I used what I learned to redesign this website. Looking for quick, simple, and delicious keto recipes! Next week will be 3 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Hoping to travel to Scotland (Glasgow, the Highlands, Edinburgh) in Fall 2021, but more likely Spring/Summer 2022.</p>
